A lot of the generic pool installation instructions still apply except
for the java/dcache related parts. But ganglia configuration,
filesystemet setup, tcp tuning and more still applies. Basically
things that the dcache user cannot fix.

Prereqs:
- bash as shell for dcache user
- bash installed as /bin/bash
- logrotate installed
- dcache_netports_min to dcache_netports_max open in the firewall
- cron installed, running and the dcache user allowed to use it
- Space for pools ready for use, with a toplevel pooldir created and owned by the dcache user
- ssh with only public keys allowed, preferably from the world

After first config run:
- Symlink or copy the {{ pool_home_dir }}/config/92-dcache.conf file to /etc/security/limits.d
- If ~dcache/.ssh/authorized_keys is not in use on the poolnode, copy or symlink that to the correct place
